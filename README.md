## Fraud App Detection Using Sentiment Analysis

In the rapidly evolving digital ecosystem, mobile applications have become integral to 
everyday life. However, the proliferation of apps has also led to an increase in 
fraudulent applications, which pose significant risks to userâ€™s data security and privacy. 
Traditional methods for fraud detection often rely on static analysis and behavioral 
monitoring, which can be circumvented by sophisticated attackers. The primary 
challenge addressed in this project is the detection of fraudulent mobile applications. 
This project proposes a sentiment analysis-based approach to detect fraudulent 
applications. By analyzing user reviews and feedback, patterns are identified and 
sentiments that are indicative of potential fraud. To implement this solution, 
Natural language processing techniques, Classification algorithms and Sentiment 
Analysis algorithms are used.
